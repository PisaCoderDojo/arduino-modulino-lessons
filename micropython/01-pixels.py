# Animation
# Difficulty: medium
# Material:. Modulino Pixels

# Exercise:
# Using the Modulino Pixels, create a continuous animation (that never ends) that lights up one LED at a time starting from LED 0 to LED 7
# and then goes back lighting up one LED from LED 6 to LED 0 (and then repeats the sequence without ever stopping).
# At any given moment, one and only one LED is on.

# The sequence should be as follows, executed forever:
# - LED 0 on, LED 0 off, LED 1 on, LED 1 off,..., LED 7 on, LED 7 off
# - LED 6 on, LED 6 off, LED 5 on, LED 5 off, â€¦ , LED 1 on, LED 1 off
